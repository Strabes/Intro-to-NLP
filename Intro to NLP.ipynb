    "Natural Language Processing is a field combining linguistics and computer science to analyze natural language data and perform various tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is a broad topic that covers many different tasks. Common tasks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Text Classification - Predict the topic of a news article from a predefined set of topics.\n",
    "2. Named Entity Recognition - If \"apple\" is used in a sentence does it refer to fruit or a company?\n",
    "3. Question Answering - Given a context text, answer a question about it.\n",
    "4. Text Summarization - Produce a summary of a given text.\n",
    "5. Translation - Translate English to Spanish\n",
    "6. Text Generation - Given a prompt, write a story.\n",
    "7. Dialogue State Tracking - Given a conversation, record key facts about it.\n",
    "8. Topic modeling - Given a corpus of texts, discover common topics."
